## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I usually using grid with standard code and this challenge i used "repeat". I practice repeating the button functions.

```css
.card-groups {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}
```
```js
removeButtons.forEach((button) => {
  button.addEventListener("click", () => {
    const cards = button.closest(".card");
    if (cards) {
      cards.remove();
    }
  });
});
```

### Continued development

I focus to build responsive website
